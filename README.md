Arduino based soil humidity and temperature monitor

The temperature and the soil humidity sensors print the data on the LCD display. One scanning cycle is set to take 10 seconds so we can determine when 24 hours have past. If that's the case, a pump will be powerd on for five seconds to water the plant.
